					<h4>The Chair</h4>
					<p class="description"> The Mademoiselle is an elegant yet vivacious chair, with a style which harks back to the 1960's.
						  A flamboyant and bold textile set into a form and structure that is quintessentially modernist; 
						  it encapsulates the dichotomy of an era, trying to embrace both order and anarchy.</p>

					<h4>The Chair</h4>
					<p class="description"> A comfortable armchair in transparent and colored polycarbonate
					 in the Louis XV style.  It is the quintessence of baroque revisited to dazzle, excite and captivate.
					   Louis Ghost is the most daring example in the world of injected polycarbonate in a single mold. 
					   Despite its evanescent and crystalline appearance, Louis Ghost is stable and durable,
					    shock and weather resistant and can also be stacked six high.</p>
